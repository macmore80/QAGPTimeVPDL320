The Cognex Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties.
3.	License Grant. Subject to and conditional upon Licensee’s payment of the License Fees and compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cognex grants to Licensee a world-wide, non-exclusive, personal, nontransferable limited license during the Term (the “License”) to use the Cognex Software in its object code form and in accordance with its documentation, as installed or in conjunction with (i) a single Cognex vision processor or Cognex hardware module, or (ii) a single PC, or (iii) any other single hardware module capable of operating the Cognex Software, for Licensee’s own internal purposes.  If Licensee is an authorized reseller (distributor, VAR or OEM) of Cognex products, then License shall be permitted to sub-license the Cognex Software to Licensee’s direct end user customers, and/or any intermediary customers selling to direct end user customers, as applicable. Such sub-licenses shall only be granted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and a copy of this Agreement shall be provided by Licensee to such customers prior to or contemporaneous with any such sub-license, with a reasonable opportunity for Licensee’s customers to review the terms hereof prior to use of or payment for the Cognex Software or the product containing or bundled together with the Cognex Software. Under any such sub-license, (i) Licensee’s customers shall be subject to any and all Licensee obligations hereunder, and shall constitute an additional Licensee for the purposes hereof, and (ii) Licensee shall include a notice that indicates to its customers that its product contains copyrighted software under license from Cognex. Licensee agrees that this Agreement also inures to the benefit of any third party holding any right, title, or interest in the Cognex Software licensed hereunder or any software from which such Cognex Software was derived. In the event that the Cognex Software delivery subject to this License is to be used in a processor, hardware module or PC that previously hosted Cognex Software, and the current Cognex Software deliverable is to replace the previous Cognex Software (whether as a functional upgrade or otherwise), then upon installation of the current replacement Cognex Software the license to use the previous Cognex Software shall expire in its entirety and all usage of the previous Cognex Software (whether in another processor, hardware module or PC, or otherwise) must cease. Once such expiration of the previous Cognex Software license takes effect, it cannot be revived.
4.	Sample Source Code License.  The Cognex Software may contain sample source code that Licensee is permitted to include in Licensee’s applications subject to this Sample Source Code License.  Subject to Licensee’s compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cognex grants to Licensee a world-wide, non-exclusive, personal, nontransferable, limited, royalty free license (the “Sample Source Code License”) to modify and copy the sample source code and to develop and distribute to Licensee’s end-user customers applications, in object code form, that run on or in conjunction with Cognex products.
5.	Copies.  Licensee may make copy of the Cognex Software solely for archival purposes and one copy of the Cognex Software solely for backup purposes, provided that Licensee shall not, and shall not allow any person to, install or use any such copy other than if and for so long as the copy installed in accordance with the preceding sentence is inoperable and, provided, further, that Licensee uninstalls and otherwise deletes such inoperable copy(ies). All copies of the Cognex Software made by the Licensee: (i) will be the exclusive property of the Cognex; (ii) will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (iii) must include all trademark, copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights notices contained in the original. Other than for archival and backup purposes, Licensee may not make any copies of the Cognex Software.
6.	Restrictions on Use.  Without the prior written consent of Cognex, Licensee shall not, and shall not aid, abet, or permit any third party to: (i) use (including make any copies of) the Cognex Software beyond the scope of the License granted under Section 2); (ii) decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying ideas, file formats, interoperability interfaces or algorithms of the Cognex Software by any means whatsoever, except as may be required by applicable third party licenses; (iii) remove, alter, delete or obscure any trademarks or any copyright, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notices provided on or with the Cognex Software or, including any copy thereof; (iv) lease, lend or use the Cognex Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes; (v) modify, translate, adapt, or otherwise create a derivative work of any part of the Cognex Software; (vi) develop methods to enable unauthorized parties to use the Cognex Software; (vii) publish or otherwise provide the results of any benchmark test run on the Cognex Software, in comparison with any third party software; (ix) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense (except as permitted by Section 2), publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Cognex Software, or any features or functionality of the Cognex Software, to any third party for any reason, whether or not over a network or on a hosted basis, including in connection with the internet or any web hosting, wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), virtualization, time-sharing, service bureau, software as a service, cloud, or other technology or service; or (x) use the Cognex Software in violation of any law, regulation, or rule. Licensee is further prohibited from installing and/or running the Cognex Software on a host PC or hardware module, and then subsequently allowing a second PC or other hardware module or device to send data to or otherwise interface with the host PC or hardware module for the purpose of requesting that any vision processing be performed or any results returned, and shall not aid, abet, or permit any third party to do so.  Licensee shall not provide or otherwise make available the Cognex Software or any part or copies thereof in any form to any third party, except as provided herein and to the extent applicable, unless so authorized in writing by Cognex. Cognex Software may be subject and limited to usage with a Cognex hardware security device, license key access codes or other hardware or software security access measures, at the sole discretion of Cognex.   Licensee is expressly prohibited from using any portion or version of the Cognex Software with any other software or copyrighted work in such a way that any portion or version of the Cognex Software would be required by the license terms applicable to the other software or work to be (a) made available in source code form, (b) made available without charge or at minimal charge, (c) licensed for the creation of derivative works or (d) which would require Cognex or its licensors to grant any third party any rights or immunities under any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Cognex. Licenses granted for development purposes may not be used to support product deployments, whether for internal use or external sale, and such usage is expressly prohibited. 
7.

The prohibitions of the preceding sentence also apply to the design, manufacture, construction, operation and maintenance activities associated with any Prohibited Use. “Life-Critical” devices or systems are defined as those (a) whose failure or malfunction may result in death or serious injury to people or environmental harm posing a serious risk to human health and safety or (b) which are designed to lose less than one life per billion hours of operation. Cognex disclaims any liability in connection with any Prohibited Use by Licensee, intermediary customers or end users, and any such Prohibited Use engaged in by a party contrary to this provision shall be entirely at such party’s risk. 
8.	Licensee is responsible and liable for all use of the Cognex Software through access thereto provided by Licensee, directly or indirectly. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee is responsible and liable for all actions and failures to take required actions with respect to the Cognex Software by its authorized users or by any other person or entity to whom Licensee or an authorized user may provide access to or use of the Cognex Software, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement.
9.	Updates/Supplements. This Agreement applies to updates, supplements, add-on components, or product support services for the Cognex Software that Licensee may obtain after the date Licensee obtain Licensee’s initial copy of the Cognex Software, unless Licensee accepted updated terms or another agreement applies.
10.	Use of Data. “Licensee Data” means all Licensee data and images processed by the Cognex Software in connection with Licensee’s use of the Cognex Software. Licensee shall own all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to Licensee Data. Licensee hereby grants Cognex a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free right and license to access, use, copy, process and store the Licensee Data for the purpose of (i) providing the Cognex Software, and (ii) analyzing, improving and supporting the Cognex Software.
11.	Privacy and Data Protection. Licensee shall not provide any personally identifiable information relating to individual persons (“PII”) in connection with its use of the Cognex Software, unless Cognex expressly agrees to receive such information and then solely as necessary in connection with Licensee’s use of the Cognex Software. Licensee is responsible for any such PII that Licensee provides to Cognex. Licensee will have in place a privacy policy regarding its use of PII, where applicable shall obtain the necessary consents before transferring any personal data to Licensor and shall comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection and use of PII and personal data.
12.	Warranty Disclaimers. ALL COGNEX SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS.  COGNEX AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY COGNEX SOFTWARE AND DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR LACK OF VIRUSES; WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE; AND ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT. COGNEX DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE COGNEX SOFTWARE WILL MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF COGNEX SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.  
13.	Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COGNEX BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY, FOR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY, INCLUDING ANY DUTY OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, FOR NEGLIGENCE AND FOR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER), ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE COGNEX SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
14.	Limitation of Liability.  Notwithstanding any damages that may be incurred for any reason whatsoever, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, the entire liability of Cognex and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy hereunder shall be limited to the amount paid by Licensee for the Cognex Software.  The foregoing limitations, exclusions and disclaimers (including the paragraphs titled “Warranty Disclaimers” and “Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages”) shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.
15.	All License Fees are payable in advance in the manner set forth in the Order Form and are non-refundable. Any renewal of the license shall not be effective until the fees for such renewal have been paid in full. 
16.	 Term and Termination. This Agreement and the Licenses hereunder shall remain in effect for the term set forth on the Order Form or until earlier terminated as set forth herein (the “Term”). This Agreement and the Licenses hereunder shall completely and automatically terminate upon Licensee’s failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee may terminate this Agreement by ceasing to use and destroying all copies of the Cognex Software. Cognex may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately, if Licensee files, or has filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or pursuant to any other insolvency law, makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or applies for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or custodian for a substantial part of its property. Upon expiration or termination, Licensee shall cease all use of the Cognex Software and return to Cognex or destroy the Cognex Software and related materials in Licensee’s possession, and so certify to Cognex.  No expiration or termination shall affect Licensee’s obligation to pay all Licensee Fees that may have become due before such expiration or termination or entitle Licensee to any refund. Such termination shall not affect any sub-licenses previously granted by Licensee to its customers in accordance with terms of this Agreement, provided that such sub-licenses were valid at the time of their creation and such customer sub-licensee(s) are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except for the License granted herein, and as otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms of this Agreement shall survive termination. 
17.	Open Source Software.  The Cognex Software may include one or more components that are derived from software subject to a General Public License (‘GPL”), Lesser General Public License (“LGPL”) or other open source license. Any such components are licensed exclusively under such GPL, LGPL or other open source license, as applicable, and not under this Agreement. It is Licensee’s responsibility to ensure (i) compliance with such open source licenses and (ii) that the requirements of such are adequately conveyed to any of its sub-licensees. 
18.	U.S. Government End Users. Cognex Software is (i) a “Commercial Item” as defined in 48 CFR 2.101, (ii) provided only as "Commercial Computer Software" and/or "Commercial Computer Software Documentation” and (iii) subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 12.212 or 48 CFR 227.7202, as applicable, or successor provisions. Any Cognex Software which is acquired directly or indirectly for or on behalf of the United States of America, its agencies and/or instrumentalities ("U.S. Government"), is provided only with those rights granted to other end users herein and pursuant to the terms hereof, and use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government is further subject to subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause at 48 CFR 52.227-19, as applicable, or successor provisions. Manufacturer is Cognex Corporation, One Vision Drive, Natick, MA 01760-2059. Cognex Software is licensed on the open market at market prices, and was developed entirely at private expense and without the use of any U.S. Government funds.
19.	Export Restrictions.  Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Cognex Software, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as import, export, re-export, end use, end user and country destination restrictions issued by the U.S. and other governments with jurisdiction concerning the Cognex Software. 
20.	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
21.	Verification and Audit Rights. Licensee shall conduct an annual review of its use the Cognex Software and certify to Cognex in writing that it is in full compliance with this Agreement or, if Licensee discovers any noncompliance then Licensee shall immediately remedy such noncompliance and provide Cognex with written notice thereof. Licensee shall provide Cognex with all assistance as Cognex reasonably requests to further evaluate and remedy such noncompliance. Upon request of Cognex, Licensee shall also allow Cognex to conduct a reasonable onsite or remote audit of the applicable Licensee facilities, products and records to determine whether or not Licensee’s usage of such Cognex Software is in conformance with this Agreement. Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Cognex in any such audit, which shall be conducted during Licensee’s normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. If the audit determines that the Licensee’s use of the Cognex Software exceeds or exceeded the use permitted by this Agreement then: (i)  Licensee shall, within ten (10) days following the date of Cognex’s written notification thereof, pay to Cognex the retroactive License Fees for such excess use and obtain and pay for a valid license to bring Licensee’s use into compliance with this Agreement. In determining the Licensee Fee payable pursuant to the foregoing, (x) unless Licensee can demonstrate otherwise by documentary evidence, all excess use of the Cognex Software shall be deemed to have commenced on the commencement date of this Agreement or, if later, the completion date of any audit previously conducted by Cognex hereunder, and continued uninterrupted thereafter, and (y) the rates for such licenses shall be determined without regard to any discount to which Licensee may have been entitled had such use been properly licensed prior to its commencement (or deemed commencement). If the use exceeds or exceeded the use permitted by this Agreement by more than twenty percent (20%), Cognex shall also have the right to terminate this Agreement and the license granted hereunder, effective immediately upon written notice to Licensee. Cognex’s remedies set forth in this Section 21 are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies Cognex may have at law or in equity, whether under this Agreement or otherwise. 
22.	Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by Licensee without the prior written consent of Cognex. Cognex may assign or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without notice to Licensee.
23.	Equitable Relief. The parties agree that a breach of this Agreement adversely affecting Cognex’s intellectual property rights in the Cognex Software will cause irreparable injury to Cognex for which monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy and Cognex shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law.
24.	No Waiver. Failure by Cognex to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder.
25.	Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement or portion thereof to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
26.	Entire Agreement. Together with the Order Form, this Agreement (including any addendum or amendment which is included with the Cognex Software) sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between the parties and may be amended only in a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.  No vendor, distributor, reseller, dealer, retailer, sales person or other person is authorized by Cognex to modify this Agreement or to make any warranty, representation, or promise which is different than, or in addition to, the warranties, representations, or promises made in this Agreement. Nothing contained in any purchase order shall in any way add to, modify, replace or supersede any terms or conditions of this Agreement.

LEGAL ISSUES

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

LICENSE ISSUES
==============

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

Libarchive
The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files; the actual statements in the files are controlling.

* Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files) and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of this file.

* The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source files for details:
   libarchive/archive_entry.c
   libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
   libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
   libarchive/mtree.5

* The following source files are in the public domain:
   libarchive/archive_getdate.c

* The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts, and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts seems to be an unavoidable mess.
